Docker Github Actions Runner
============================

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/myoung34/github-runner.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/myoung34/github-runner) [![awesome-runners](https://img.shields.io/badge/listed%20on-awesome--runners-blue.svg)](https://github.com/jonico/awesome-runners)

This will run the [new self-hosted github actions runners](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/hosting-your-own-runners).

## Notes ##

### Docker Support ###

Please note that while this runner installs and allows docker, github actions itself does not support using docker from a self hosted runner yet.
For more information:

* https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/406
* https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/367

Also, some GitHub Actions Workflow features, like [Job Services](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-service-containers), won't be usable and [will result in an error](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner/issues/61).

These containers are built via Github actions that [copy the dockerfile](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml#L47), changing the `FROM` and building to provide simplicity.

## Environment Variables ##

| Environment Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RUNNER_NAME` | The name of the runner to use. Supercedes (overrides) `RUNNER_NAME_PREFIX` |
| `RUNNER_NAME_PREFIX` | A prefix for a randomly generated name (followed by a random 13 digit string). You must not also provide `RUNNER_NAME`. Defaults to `github-runner` |
| `ACCESS_TOKEN` | A [github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) to use to generate `RUNNER_TOKEN` dynamically at container start. Not using this requires a valid `RUNNER_TOKEN` |
| `RUNNER_SCOPE` | The scope the runner will be registered on. Valid values are `repo`, `org` and `ent`. For 'org' and 'enterprise', `ACCESS_TOKEN` is required and `REPO_URL` is unneccesary. If 'org', requires `ORG_NAME`; if 'enterprise', requires `ENTERPRISE_NAME`. Default is 'repo'. |
| `ORG_NAME` | The organization name for the runner to register under. Requires `RUNNER_SCOPE` to be 'org'. No default value. |
| `ENTERPRISE_NAME` | The enterprise name for the runner to register under. Requires `RUNNER_SCOPE` to be 'enterprise'. No default value. |
| `LABELS` | A comma separated string to indicate the labels. Default is 'default' |
| `REPO_URL` | If using a non-organization runner this is the full repository url to register under such as 'https://github.com/myoung34/repo' |
| `RUNNER_TOKEN` | If not using a PAT for `ACCESS_TOKEN` this will be the runner token provided by the Add Runner UI (a manual process). Note: This token is short lived and will change frequently. `ACCESS_TOKEN` is likely preferred. |
| `RUNNER_WORKDIR` | The working directory for the runner. Runners on the same host should not share this directory. Default is '/_work'. This must match the source path for the bind-mounted volume at RUNNER_WORKDIR, in order for container actions to access files. |
| `RUNNER_GROUP` | Name of the runner group to add this runner to (defaults to the default runner group) |
| `GITHUB_HOST` | Optional URL of the Github Enterprise server e.g github.mycompany.com. Defaults to `github.com`. |
| `DISABLE_AUTOMATIC_DEREGISTRATION` | Optional flag to disable signal catching for deregistration. Default is `false`. Any value other than exactly `false` is considered `true`. See [here](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner/issues/94) |
| `CONFIGURED_ACTIONS_RUNNER_FILES_DIR` | Path to use for runner data. It allows avoiding reregistration each the start of the runner. No default value. |

## Examples ##

### Note ###

If you're using a RHEL based OS with SELinux, add `--security-opt=label=disable` to prevent [permission denied](https://github.com/myoung34/docker-github-actions-runner/issues/9)

### Manual ###

```shell
# org runner
docker run -d --restart always --name github-runner \
  -e RUNNER_NAME_PREFIX="myrunner" \
  -e ACCESS_TOKEN="footoken" \
  -e RUNNER_WORKDIR="/tmp/github-runner-your-repo" \
  -e RUNNER_GROUP="my-group" \
  -e RUNNER_SCOPE="org" \
  -e ORG_NAME="octokode" \
  -e LABELS="my-label,other-label" \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp/github-runner-your-repo:/tmp/github-runner-your-repo \
  myoung34/github-runner:latest
# per repo
docker run -d --restart always --name github-runner \
  -e REPO_URL="https://github.com/myoung34/repo" \
  -e RUNNER_NAME="foo-runner" \
  -e RUNNER_TOKEN="footoken" \
  -e RUNNER_WORKDIR="/tmp/github-runner-your-repo" \
  -e RUNNER_GROUP="my-group" \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp/github-runner-your-repo:/tmp/github-runner-your-repo \
  myoung34/github-runner:latest
```

Adding the reusage of the registered runner (can be propogated to all other approaches):

```shell
# per repo
docker run -d --restart always --name github-runner \
  -e REPO_URL="https://github.com/myoung34/repo" \
  -e RUNNER_NAME="foo-runner" \
  -e RUNNER_TOKEN="footoken" \
  -e RUNNER_WORKDIR="/tmp/github-runner-your-repo" \
  -e RUNNER_GROUP="my-group" \
  -e CONFIGURED_ACTIONS_RUNNER_FILES_DIR="/actions-runner-files" \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp/github-runner-your-repo:/tmp/github-runner-your-repo \
  -v /tmp/foo:/actions-runner-files \
  myoung34/github-runner:latest
```

Shell wrapper:

```shell
function github-runner {
    name=github-runner-${1//\//-}
    org=$(dirname $1)
    repo=$(basename $1)
    tag=${3:-latest}
    docker rm -f $name
    docker run -d --restart=always \
        -e REPO_URL="https://github.com/${org}/${repo}" \
        -e RUNNER_TOKEN="$2" \
        -e RUNNER_NAME="linux-${repo}" \
        -e RUNNER_WORKDIR="/tmp/github-runner-${repo}" \
        -e RUNNER_GROUP="my-group" \
        -e LABELS="my-label,other-label" \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        -v /tmp/github-runner-${repo}:/tmp/github-runner-${repo} \
        --name $name myoung34/github-runner:latest
}

      - '/tmp/runner:/tmp/runner'
      # note: a quirk of docker-in-docker is that this path
      # needs to be the same path on host and inside the container,
      # docker mgmt cmds run outside of docker but expect the paths from within

## Usage From GH Actions Workflow ##

```yml
name: Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: self-hosted
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: build packages
      run: make all
```

## Automatically Acquiring a Runner Token  ##

A runner token can be automatically acquired at runtime if `ACCESS_TOKEN` (a GitHub personal access token) is a supplied. This uses the [GitHub Actions API](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/self_hosted_runners/#create-a-registration-token). e.g.:

```shell
docker run -d --restart always --name github-runner \
  -e ACCESS_TOKEN="footoken" \
  -e RUNNER_NAME="foo-runner" \
  -e RUNNER_WORKDIR="/tmp/github-runner-your-repo" \
  -e RUNNER_GROUP="my-group" \
  -e RUNNER_SCOPE="org" \
  -e ORG_NAME="octokode" \
  -e LABELS="my-label,other-label" \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp/github-runner-your-repo:/tmp/github-runner-your-repo \
  myoung34/github-runner:latest
```

## Create GitHub personal access token  ##

Creating GitHub personal access token (PAT) for using by self-hosted runner make sure the following scopes are selected:

* repo (all)
* admin:org (all) **_(mandatory for organization-wide runner)_**
* admin:enterprise (all) **_(mandatory for enterprise-wide runner)_**
* admin:public_key - read:public_key
* admin:repo_hook - read:repo_hook
* admin:org_hook
* notifications
* workflow

Also, when creating a PAT for self-hosted runner which will process events from several repositories of the particular organization, create the PAT using organization owner account. Otherwise your new PAT will not have sufficient privileges for all repositories.

## Run a runner on enterprise scope  ##

```shell
docker run -d --restart always --name github-runner \
  -e ACCESS_TOKEN="footoken" \
  -e RUNNER_NAME="foo-runner" \
  -e RUNNER_WORKDIR="/tmp/github-runner-your-repo" \
  -e RUNNER_GROUP="my-group" \
  -e RUNNER_SCOPE="enterprise" \
  -e ENTERPRISE_NAME="my-enterprise" \
  -e LABELS="my-label,other-label" \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp/github-runner-your-repo:/tmp/github-runner-your-repo \
  myoung34/github-runner:latest
```
